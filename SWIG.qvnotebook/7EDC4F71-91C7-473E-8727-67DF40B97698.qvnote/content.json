However, once I changed the typemap code to use `$lname` instead of `CTYPE`, this meant that the actual typedef `vector::size_type` (rather than the resolved name `int`) was being injected into the wrapper code. So an `int*` was being implicitly used as a `size_t*` which is of course a problem if the two are different sizes."
