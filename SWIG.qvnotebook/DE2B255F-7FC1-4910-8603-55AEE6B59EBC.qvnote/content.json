Every ECP project will be expected to provide a poster. Posters should be mounted on day one of the meeting and remain up for the duration of the meeting.\n> \n> The purpose of the poster session is to promote face-to-face dialogue between ECP project representatives on topics of potential collaboration and requirements-sharing. You or someone on your team should be present at your poster space during the session you've been assigned to, to engage with other project teams. You will want to present material in your poster session that will help others understand your project and how you might interact with it from a different project's perspective.\n> \n> There are 30 boards that have a pinable area of 45.5” x 69.5” and ten that the entire surface is pinable, so 48\"x72\"; each project PI will be assigned one space. For more details about the poster board display, see http://www.tds-exhibits.com/what-we-do/#boards. We plan on two posters per board, per side.\n> \n> If you would like to submit a request for additional space, contact Lora Wolfe (wolfelm@ornl.gov). Lora will notify you which poster session day you've been assigned.\n> \n> Please incorporate the ECP logo [download](https://exascaleproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ECP_logos.zip)  in your poster(s). Any posters remaining after February 8, 5:00pm, will be removed."
